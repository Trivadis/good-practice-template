## About Good Practice Guide

Welcome to the Trivadis *Good Practice* Guide for XYZ. This guide is a
community-effort to establish a framework of good practices for XYZ. It is about
standardizing and simplifying the configuration and use of XYZ using good
practices.

In today's IT world, robust and secure applications and systems are becoming
increasingly important. Many business processes no longer function without IT
and the dependency of companies on their IT has grown enormously, which means
that we need robust and maintainable applications and infrastructures. An
important prerequisite is standards and guidelines that allow source code or
infrastructure configurations created by multiple people to be maintained
quickly and easily. This is the basis of a well-functioning IT environment in
the cloud and on-premises.

Good standards and guidelines are based on the wealth of experience and
knowledge gained from past (and future?) problems, such as those that can occur
in a cloud environment.
