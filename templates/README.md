# Template Files

This folder contains various template files used to generate the different
formats. The templates are based on the Trivadis corporate identity. The
original templates are either in the container
[oehrlis/pandoc](https://hub.docker.com/r/oehrlis/pandoc/builds) or in the
GitHub repository [oehrlis/pandoc](https://github.com/oehrlis/pandoc_template).
It is prudent to update these local templates from time to time.
