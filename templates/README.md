# Template Files

This folder is intended for project-specific template files, which are used to
generate the various formats. The current Trivadis specific pandoc templates or
reference documents are always part of the docker image
[oehrlis/pandoc](https://hub.docker.com/r/oehrlis/pandoc/builds) or can be
downloaded directly from the corresponding GitHub repository
[oehrlis/pandoc](https://github.com/oehrlis/pandoc_template). It is recommended
to use the current templates and to make project-specific additions only if
necessary.

If you do have a local *pandoc* installation including LaTeX, you may store a
local copy of the templates in this folder to specify them via command line.
