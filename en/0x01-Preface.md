## About Good Practice Guide

The Oracle Critical Patch Advisory is released every three months and addresses
major security issues in Oracle databases, application servers and other
Oracle products. In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether a critical
patch needs to be applied immediately in a production environment or not.
This is where the Trivadis Critical Patch Report comes in. Trivadis tests
several critical patches on different Oracle products and versions. In
particular, the Critical Patch Updates for the Oracle databases on the
SUN, AIX, Linux and Windows platforms as well as the Oracle Application
Server, which is tested under Linux and Windows. The test results are
summarized in the TVD-CriticalPatchReport and released in the same cycle.
The report helps to decide whether a Critical Patch Update needs to be
installed or not and provides valuable tips.

Your benefits

* Recommendations: When to install the patch and when not to.
* Tips to keep in mind when installing the CPU.
* Information about whether the database will behave differently after
  the CPU has been installed.

The TVD-CriticalPatchReport is distributed to Trivadis customers as part of
